          <p class="headline">
            <strong>Klenengan Pujangga Laras</strong> is a monthly gathering of
            Javanese gamelan musicians in Surakarta, Central Java.
          </p>
          <p>
            Started in July 2001, this klenengan was originally sponsored by
            members of the North American gamelan community and is now supported
            internationally. More than 35 gamelan enthusiasts sponsor 11 events
            a year, attended by 50-60 musicians.
          </p>
          <p>The <strong>purposes</strong> of the klenengan are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="home">
              To thank our Javanese teachers for everything they have given us.
            </li>
            <li class="home">
              To allow musicians from all different alliances, young and old, to
              gather together.
            </li>
            <li class="home">
              To provide an open opportunity to play, which the participants
              themselves shape.
            </li>
            <li class="home">To document karawitan in its present form.</li>
            <li class="home">
              To add one more classical event to the Solo calendar, so dominated
              now by campursari, dangdut, karaoke, Sragenan, and Western pop
              music.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The <strong>funding model</strong> is one of subscription.
            Supporters are encouraged to give US$400 per year (which comes to
            about $35 per klenengan). Lesser amounts are of course welcome, as
            well as one time donations, but the financial sustainibility of the
            klenengan relies on a core of regular contributions at the
            recommended amount.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a perk, subscribers can access or receive
            <a href="http://dustyfeet.com/pl/audio/index.html"
              >audio documentation</a
            >
            and private links to live streaming video, which are available even
            after the event.
