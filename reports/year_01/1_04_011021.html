							Year 1, #4
						</h2>
						<p>
							<b>Saturday, 21 October 2001</b><br>
							<b>Kerajinan Gamelan Bp. Mulyadi, Lojiwetan, Solo</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							The fourth American-sponsored klenengan took place last night at Bapak Mulyad's in Lojiwetan, Solo. The musicians started at around 8:30 pm and finished at about 2:00 am. Mas Wakidi and I walked in right at 8:15, as he'd just picked me up at the airport from a delayed Jakarta flight. Usually I arrive on Friday night but, well, long story. Anyway, there was a full group, seemingly just waiting for us--hence the lateish start. I wish they had just started--but they all seemed very cautious, and wondering if we weren't there because of all the anti-American sentiment, etc. If we hadn't have shown, I think they would have deemed it inappropriate to have the klenengan, even though it's supposed to sort of run itself. Many, many musicians expressed their absolute horror at the anti-American demos that have been taking place lately.
						</p>
						<p>
							The klenengan was, again, very successful, despite the absences of a number of regulars due to illness, exhaustion on the part of palace musicians (who had, in the late afternoon, just completed weeks of coronation activities), and uncertainty on the part of a few as to whether the klenengan would take place in the midst of so much anti-Americanism in the streets. There is a fair bit of anti-American sentiment--demos every day in Jakarta and a small, militant group of anti-American types centered right here in Solo. The residents of Kraton Inggris each have their own personal security guard assigned to them (not that they always show up....). But things have been calming down a bit lately and it seems safe here for the moment.
						</p>
						<p>
							The next klenengan will be on Saturday night, November 17th. The December klenengan is being moved to the 2nd week (LEBARAN is the 3rd week)--which falls on December 8. January will be back to the 3rd week.

							<li>Gd. <b>Talimurda</b>, kt 4 mg 8 kalj. Ldr <b>Kandhamanyura</b>, pt manyura ageng, slendro
								<p>
									(same line-up)<br>
									<br>
									These first 2 gendhing were Pak Wahyos idea. He came feeling much more energized than in past months, and had clearly planned these pieces in his mind. His face was bright and he looked healthy. (He asked for Sambul Laras to go on to Ldr. Lagu but the kendhang players didnt hear.)

							<li>Gd. <b>Budheng-Budheng</b> kt 2 awis mg kt 4 kalj. Ldr. <b>Soroyudo</b>, pl 6

									(same line-up)

							<li>pt. Sanga wantah, Bawa <b>Maesa Bayangan</b> (Panut), Gd. <b>Mandhul</b> kt 4 mg 8 kalj Ldr <b>Gonjang Ganjing "Liktho"</b>, pt jugag
								<p>
									Rb: Raji, Gd: Wakidjo, Kd: Wakidi, Bn: Yadi, Gb: Wakiyo<br>
									<br>
									Gendhing was at Pak Wakidjos request, Ldr was Yadis idea, leading from bonang, both lagu and irama.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>Pt. Pl 7 jugag, Jn <b>Uler Kambang</b>, pl 7, Jn. <b>Glathik Glindhing</b>, pl 7<br>
								<br>
							</li>
							<li>Bawa <b>Swanpati</b>, Gd. <b>Ludira Madu</b> mg Kinanthi <b>Puspanjana</b> kalj. Ldr. <b>Sri Katon</b>
								<p>
									Rb: Raji, Gd: Sular, Kd: Kamso, Bn: Yadi, Gb: Wakiyo and Sutat--switching back and forth (they were getting punchy--its hard to explain, but at any rate don't count on this as a Pak Wakiyo gambang study tape.)<br>
									<br>
									Somehow this group cant seem to play a klenengan without using an out-there verison of minggah Kinanthi--usually Lobong, this time from Ludira Madu. Mas Kamso got punchy and started imitating Pak Mujiono's kendhangan--in general and specifically from past klenengan with mg Kinanthi. It was somehow five times funnier of course, for the musicians to see Mas Kamso do this than to hear Pak Muji really play kendhang.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>Ayak-ayakan <b>Mijil Larasati</b>, pl 7
								<p>
									(same line-up, but Pak Mujiono squeezed his way in to the kendhang, after all that imitating, to give everyone a taste of the original.)

							In the end, we did have plenty of musicians, and the klenengan had a very nice, kind of intimate feel, with not as many musicians sitting out a piece with nothing to play as have in past months. We spent $400 or Rp. 400,000 (1$ = Rp. 10,000).
